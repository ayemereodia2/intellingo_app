# Reader App - Simplified Meaning with BERT

## Overview

The **Reader App** is a web-based application designed to help users quickly understand the meaning of highlighted text within a document. The app uses **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to generate simplified explanations for any part of the text that is highlighted by the user.

### Features:
- **Highlighting**: Users can click and highlight text within a document.
- **Simplified Meaning**: After highlighting, the app fetches a simplified explanation of the selected text using the BERT model.
- **Interactive UI**: The app displays the explanation above the highlighted text or in a dedicated explanation area.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **BERT**: Utilized for text analysis and generation of simplified meanings.
- **Backend** (Optional): Node.js and Express (if you decide to use a server for processing the BERT model)
- **API**: Fetches data from an API that processes the text and uses BERT to provide explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Node.js and npm (for development setup)

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if using Node.js backend for BERT processing):
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   
   If you're using a backend, you can run the app locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or simply open the `index.html` file in your browser for a front-end only version.

### How to Use:

1. **Open the Reader App** in your browser.
2. **Upload a document** (if applicable). The app can process text files or render static content.
3. **Highlight text** by selecting the part of the text you want to understand better.
4. **View the simplified meaning** of the highlighted text in the explanation box below the document or in a popup.
   
   The app will use BERT to analyze the context of the highlighted text and return a simpler, easier-to-understand explanation.

### Example Workflow:

1. The user selects a sentence like:  
   `"The stock market is influenced by many factors including government policies."`
   
2. The app sends this sentence to the backend (if any) or uses a preloaded BERT model to process the text.
   
3. The BERT model returns an explanation like:  
   `"The stock market can change due to many reasons, like decisions made by the government."`

4. The explanation is displayed within the app.

### Explanation Model (BERT):

- **BERT** is a powerful natural language processing model developed by Google, which is used to understand the meaning of words in a sentence based on the context.
- In this app, BERT is used to analyze the highlighted text and provide a clearer, simplified version that is easier for users to understand.
